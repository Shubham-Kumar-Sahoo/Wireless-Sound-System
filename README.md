# Wireless-Sound-System
In this project, I have used opencv and mediapipe libraries to implement Wireless Sound Control in which we can control the volume of our system wirelessly through our fingers.

To install the required python libraries, execute the following command in the terminal :-  
-pip install -r requirments.txt

## Run
python WirelessSoundControl.py
